# inari-glue
Glue is a lightweight object tree serializer, supporting to serialize a whole object tree (in memory) to a certain format like XML or Json or load and instantiate such a object tree from certain file format.

For now there is just XML support
Json support is in planing

Each object that should have the ability to be serialized to or loaded form file has to implement a specified Interface and has to define a configId.

There will be more documentation soon. For now please have a look at the JavaDoc and also to the UnitTests. UnitTest will explain how to work with the API.
